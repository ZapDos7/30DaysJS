    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 20;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    //prints 20, 20
    age = 30;
    console.log(age, age2);
    //prints 30, 20


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Zap'; //this also changes the last value of 'players' array
    //since 'team' is a reference to the og array!

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();//slice w/o arguements == copy of the og array == what I wanted
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;//this doesnt work cause we make reference again

    // how do we take a copy instead?
  const captain2 = Object.assign({},person,{number:99}); //{} == empty object, person = my og which i wanna copy, {number blabla} = overwritten stuff!
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //iterations wont work, for multiple levels you gotta use that function IF NEEDED!!!

    //another, not recommended way:
    const captain3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //it returns a string, not an object, so it's an odd way to do it but it works
